Just last week, preservationists at the Old Pejeta animal sanctuary in Kenya conceded that their one male and two female northern white rhinos will not reproduce naturally. The animals were flown from the Czech zoo to the Kenyan conservancy in December 2009 in hopes that the natural environment could be easier for them to breed there than in captivity.

Liverpool had its chances, but David De Gea was monstrous in goal and his attack justified his strength between the sticks as Manchester United sunk the leaky visitors 3-0 at Old Trafford. De Gea has grown into one of the world’s best goalkeepers, and his best was on display today as Liverpool couldn’t find a way through despite great chances early and often for Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli. Liverpool began the brightest, with a testing corner inside five minutes, and a solid run from Adam Lallana down the flank which drew a very early yellow for Marouane Fellaini.

Joe Philbin arrived at work at 5:50 a.m. Monday, anxious to get the Miami Dolphins headed in the right direction. He's running out of time. Consecutive dismal defeats have left the Dolphins all but eliminated from the playoffs with two games to go, and there's widespread speculation Philbin will be fired after three seasons as coach. Predictably, Philbin deflected questions about his future and said he's only focused on the upcoming game Sunday against Minnesota.

Mayweather can get the amount he wants. As early as January this year, I challenged him to a charity fight. Until now, he has not agreed to it. So, money is not the issue in our fight," Pacquiao said on his official website. "This fight is about legacy, this is about making the fans happy and, above all, this is for the good of boxing.
