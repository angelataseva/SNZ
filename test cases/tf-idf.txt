Kobe Bryant once scored 80+ points in only three quarters. They’re also, for the first time this season, the proud owners of a ten-game winning streak. On top of that, you may have heard, Kobe Bryant passed Michael Jordan on Sunday evening to move into third place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.

The latest example is the super blood wolf moon eclipse, which sounds like the name of an emo song I would have performed a modern dance routine to in 9th grade, but is, in fact, an astronomical event set to occur on January 20. As we'll explain below, there is nothing truly mystical or hardcore or otherwise special about this moon, and it will not look like a bloody wolf head in the sky or anything wild like that. We get these super-duper-lunar events by smashing together all the qualifiers we've historically used to keep track of full moons throughout the year, and in the age of the internet we can go a little overboard
